                　　When an opportunity presents itself, it brings a promise but never realizes it on its own. If you want to achieve something or intend to fulfill one of your ambitions you must work hard, make efforts and get prepared. Otherwise, you will take no advantage of opportunities when they come to visit you. It is clear that in order to be highly qualified for out future jobs, we should make every possible preparation.
                　　The difference between a man who succeeds and one who does not lies only in the way each treats opportunities. The successful person always makes adequate preparations to meet opportunities as they duly arrive. The unsuccessful person, on the other hand, works little and just waits to see them pass by. Obviously, the two different attitudes towards opportunities may lead to quite different consequences.
                　　In my opinion, there are plenty of opportunities for everyone in our society, in our society, but only those who are prepared adequately and qualified highly can make use of them to achieve their purpose.
